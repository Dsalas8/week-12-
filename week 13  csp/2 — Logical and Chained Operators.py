# Objective:
# Students will use logical (and, or, not) and chained comparison operators in Python to build compound conditions.

# Key Notes:

# and → Both conditions must be True

# or → At least one condition must be True

# not → Inverts True/False

# You can chain comparisons: 1 < x < 5

# Examples:
x = 10
print(x > 5 and x < 15)   # True
print(x < 5 or x == 10)   # True
print(not(x == 10))       # False
print(1 < x < 20)         # True

#socre calculator 
score = int(input("Enter your score(0-100:)"))
#if the score is betwen 90 and 100 
#assign grade A
if 90 <= score <= 100:
    print("Grade A")
#if score is between 80 and 89 
#assign grade B
elif 80 <= score < 90:
    print("Grade B")
#if score is between 70-79
#assign grade C
elif 70 <= score < 80:
    print("Grade C")
#if score is between 60-69
#assign grade D
elif 60 <= score < 70: 
    print("Grade D")
#if score is between 50-59 
#assign grade F
else:
    print("Grade F")


# Practice Problems:

# Write an expression that checks if a number is between 50 and 100 (inclusive).
y = 67 
print( 50 < y < 100)
# Write an expression that checks if a number is NOT equal to 0 and greater than 10.
d = 11 
print(not(0 == d > 10 ))
# Use chained comparison to check if 3 < 4 < 5.
print(3 < 4 < 5)
# Challenge: Create a password rule using logical operators:
password = input ("Enter your password")
if len(password) >= 10
    print("Correct Password")
else:
    print("Incorrect password")
